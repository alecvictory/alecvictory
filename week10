elevator pitch - 



----------------------------------------------------------------------

Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?

In the army I had just gotten a new Company Commander who happened to be my new boss. 
It was a difficult transition for me because I went from a boss who had full trust in me to get whatever needed to be done handled and he didn't have to worry about it, to a boss who micromanaged me about every aspect of work that I did for him.
I suggested that instead of him constantly checking up on my progress on certain projects that I will have an update board that he can reference to and see my progress or a task that I was currently working on.
This option helped with work flow and without constantly being distracted and having to explain myself many times a day on what was happening or what project I was working on at the time.

Tell me about the first job you’ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?

My first job I started working at Dairy Queen when I was 16
I first learned by watching others and how they handled tasks and orders and the way the managers expected them to be handled
If i was ever confused about a situation I would ask the person who knew the most about it at the time.
This proved to be extremely useful because it showed my willingness to learn and improve which made the supervisors and managers to start trusting me with more important tasks.

Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?

I was assigned as my unit's information systems security officer. 
The first task I was given was to fix the time it took for user's to recieve their SIPR tokens (secret network computer access). 
The average time it took was 1 month and through my efforts I shortened it to a week.

Describe a time when you were the resident technical expert. What did you do to make sure everyone was able to understand you?

I was in a field exercise where one of my jobs was to explain to the higher ranking officers what our communications plan was
The approach that I took with this situation was to explain it as simply as possible and only talk about the extreme basics so that they understood
This worked extremely well because none of the officers had an IT background so by explaining it as simply as possible they were able to understand the direction that we were heading and I was able to answer their questions by explaining further into detail

Tell me about a time when you worked under close supervision or extremely loose supervision. How did you handle that?

I had a boss that would closely supervise me
By working dilligently, on time, and not having to redo my work he began trusting me to the point where he wouldn't supervise me at all. He trusted that I would get the job done ahead of schedule.
I handled it extremely well, I understood why he was closely supervising me and I wanted to prove to him that I didn't need a babysitter, once he had complete confidence in me he didn't need to supervise me and I was able to handle my own schedule.

To stand out as a candidate I believe that I need to spend more time working on whiteboard challenges to get better at technical interviews. I also believe to stand out is to work on my own independent projects and landing page so they can see I have a passion for software development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenge 1 - Taylor Oppedyk/Austin Downey - fizzbuzz
I struggled with fizzbuzz since it was my first whiteboard challenge, I had to have help every step of the way and I was a bit nervous because I understood what i needed to do, I just couldn't communicate effectively and my nerves got the better of me.

Challenge 2 - Taylor Oppedyk/Austin Downey - take a string and reverse it
I handled this challenge well, after my failure with fizzbuzz I took what i was messing up on and where i knew i needed to improve and implemented that with this new challenge. I enjoyed it.
